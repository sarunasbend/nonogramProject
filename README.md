# nonogramProject
Lancaster University First Year Summer Project.
Put a .bmp file within puzzleImages directory, to see it transform into a Nonogram puzzle. 
Only 1 bit depth and 24 bit depth is supported currently. Upon running the program, you can select
between all of your .bmp files. After selecting your desired puzzle, press play! After loading the
puzzle, you can place the colours from the image from the colour palette, following the numbers at
the top and left, in order to be able to complete it. Whilst placing the tiles, you can press the
check button to see how many tiles are left to fill in. After, filling in the nonogram, you can
press complete to see, whether or not any tiles you have placed are incorrect. If there is any
incorrectly placed or missing tiles, they will be highlighted in red. If you press complete again, 
the nonogram will be filled in, and you can see the complete nonogram puzzle.

This was a fun project to work on! Enjoy!
