# nonogramProject
To do list:
1. Finish off all the cases for bit-depth so it supports every depth
2. Have a look at how the padding is calculated for 24 bit-depth, currently encountering issue for reading the number of tiles in a row
3. Decide whether to have the BMP class be initialised within the Nonogram class or whether it should be in the Driver class
4. Start Developing a dynamic GUI, moving away from testing
